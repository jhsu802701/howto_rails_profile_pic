# Chapter 2: Showing User Profile Pictures
In this chapter, you will update the user model to allow profile pictures, seed the database, and update the user profile page and user index page to show the profile pictures.  While users will be able to have profile pictures, the process of allowing users to select a profile picture will be tackled later.  Although no tests are added in this chapter, testing will also be tackled later, and the ability to see the profile pictures at the end of this chapter will provide informal confirmation that everything works as expected.
